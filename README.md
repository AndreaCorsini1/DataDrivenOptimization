# Data Driven Optimization

This project includes materials used for teaching various courses. 
The lectures are organized into Jupyter notebook files, providing explanations alongside examples that demonstrate the discussed concepts.

The material is divided as follows:
- **Python Intro**: A brief introduction to coding in Python with exercises.
- **Machine Learning**: An overview of Python packages and Machine Learning concepts, accompanied by examples.
- **ML + MO**: Demonstrations of how Machine Learning can be integrated with Mathematical Optimization.
- **Foundation Models**: Examples of how foundation models can be used to build services for the industry.

Some of the folders also contain slides supporting the notebooks.
